#CGTA Testing Instructions ðŸ§¬

##Introduction

Hello! Thank you so much for testing my independent study project! :D

The purpose of this project is to utilize past CG@Penn class Piazza/Ed archives and ChatGPT Playground to make future TAs' lives easier by partially automating answers to Ed posts.

###How it works
I transcribed the Fall 2022 Piazza and Spring 2023 Ed archives for CIS 4600/5600: Interactive Computer Graphics, as well as the Fall 2022 Piazza archive for CIS 4620: Computer Animation, and stored them in .txt files organized by class > category > semester under the `data` folder. For the most part, you don't have to worry about these these, and you definitely shouldn't edit them, but you can look at them if you're curious.

Then, there's `app.py`, which does a lot of the heavy lifting.
