HW5 motion capture blending using different software
Do we have to use MotionBuilder for the motion capture blending, or is other software okay? I find Blender’s interface much more intuitive, and it has all the same blending and retargeting capabilities that MotionBuilder does. And I could still export as FBX and create a video render.

You can do both if you like so we can see how they compare.
So doing it in Blender alone would not be sufficient for the assignment?
that is correct.

###question @218
Is there a way to do the walk cycle keyframing with non-linear interpolation?
I am trying to make a decent walk cycle and I find some aspects, especially the arm swinging, to be looking rather robotic. I was wondering if there was a possibility of specifying non-linear (i.e. bias, gain, ease-in-out, other splines) when interpolating between the keyframes?

Maybe you can look into this: MotionBuilder Help | Key Interpolation Type menu | Autodesk

###question @222
Can we stylize the walk cycle for part 1?
Hi, just wondering if the walk cycle for part one has to be a smooth, human-like walk. If we wanted to play around with a stylized walk (for ex. a toy soldier marching or a robotic walk), is that allowed?
#hw5
Yes, you can create a stylized walk (but it should not be because of your inability to create a normal, human-like walk).

###question @226
Is there a detailed tutorial about binding motions to a character in motion builder
I didn’t find any about that
#hw5
I watched this youtube video and is super helpful.

The motion blending tutorial in the assignment folder on canvas also has instructions on how to import bvh animations and map them to the beta character.
