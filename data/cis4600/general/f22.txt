Difference between 4600/5600
Is there any difference in the sections? Considering switching to 5600.
#general
There is no difference.
5600 is for masters students or students that want to double count this course for a masters program. To switch you email your advisor.

###question @8
Is a computer mouse beneficial to have in this class, or is a trackpad sufficient?
#general
A mouse is useful to have for the final project for ergonomic purposes, but no assignment requires a mouse.

###question @13
Computer preference?
I currently use Mac air M1 and since we might use GPU in the future should I switch to laptop with RTX/GTX graphic card?
#general
As far as I remember for the purpose of assignments in 4600, Mac Air M1 has not been a problem with my friends who used it.

###question @17
Issues opening "460.pro" and configuring it to the Qt version I installed
For context, I have installed Qt 6.2.4 for MacOS. Also, when I was installing the Qt Software, I was unable to click "Qt Creator 6.0.1 CDB Debugger Support", "Debugging Tools for Windows", and "Qt Design Studio 2.3.1 community" under "Developer and Designer Tools" for the Select Components part of the setup because I wasn't given the option to click them. I asked Prof. Mally about it and he had me click "Qt Creator 8.0.1 Debug Symbols" from the list that was presented to me. 
So, I've opened "460.pro" but I get the messages in the picture below when I get to the configure part. How do I go about fixing this? Should I set up a compiler and a debugger? Thank you.
#other
Make sure to have xCode Command Line Tools installed.

###question @18
Header file generation when promoting a widget
Hi! I am wondering about if we should write our own header file each time we promote our widget or is the header file automatically generated for us? I assumed the former is true since I tried ctrl+k locate, but when creating my own header file it says that it is not automatically linked with Cmake, I am wondering if that would cause some build problems down the line.
Is this right?
Thank you.
#general
Yeah I tried this a few days ago and the same thing happened. Make your own headers. I’m not sure why this is happening + will ask the rest of the TAs to confirm. Additionally, I believe your project should be made with qmake instead of cmake.
Thanks for the answer! I realized my project is running cmake for some reason. Is there a way to convert it to qmake?
In creating a project, I realized in "build system" we are allowed to choose our build system.
Qt deciding to also support CMake is a fairly recent occurrence, so we probably have to update the tutorial instructions to include that setting during the project setup.
You won’t have to worry about this for future projects since they are all configured by default with qmake

###question @24
Commit Tab
The HW says "If you click on the Commits tab of your repository on Github, you will be brought to a list of commits you've made. Simply click on the one you wish for us to grade, then copy and paste the URL of the page into your text file"
I can't find the commit tab the HW is referencing.
#general
The link you're looking for is just under the green Code button!~ It has a clock icon and says "3 commits".
Click it and you will see the list of your commits. Then you just need to click on the commit where you added the README, and submit the link from that page on Canvas.

How to open today's lecture slides
Hi, I tried to open today's lecture slides, which links to https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis4600/19fa/lectures/460transforms3d.html#slide-0. But I only saw a blank page.
It says "Requires browser config". Could you please tell me how to configure my browser?
I use Chrome 105 on macOS.
#general
If you are using Chrome, go to Settings -> Site Settings -> Additional Content Settings -> Insecure Content and add that link! Re-open Chrome and load the URL.

###question @86
Late day policy
If late days are not used before the final project, do they just expire and not count for anything?
#general
They are not worth anything after the last homework assignment.

###question @174
NOTE: “you will never ask about pointers again after watching this vid"
https://youtu.be/2ybLD6_2gKM
Clears up some pointer/ reference confusion.
Remember when programming in C you have direct access to memory unlike other languages. A pointer is a value that is an address in memory.
