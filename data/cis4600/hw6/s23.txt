###question @185
Subdivision runtime
Roughly how many iterations of Catmull-Clark should our program be expected to run on the cube mesh before we encounter runtime issues?
#hw6
My personal implementation is able to go up to 6 subdivisions for the cube smoothly, and 7 if you are willing to wait for a couple of minutes :) So I'd say 5-6 should be good, basic idea is to see the convergence of the mesh into a sphere on each subsequent subdivision.

###question @193
Triangulate a face
In HW6, does "triangulate a face" mean "divide a face into triangles" (in Simple mesh topology operations)?
#hw6
Yes
As in make each triangle of a face into its own face object?
Yep, new Faces need to be created and added to the original mesh.

###question @198
Face colors
Should the colors of the new faces generated by Catmull-Clark and triangulation be the same color as the parent face, or new randomly generated ones?
#hw6
You can do it either way. It's up to you!

###question @200
If you divide an edge twice and then triangulating it is possible to create a new face with zero area:
e.g. dividing edge 1->4 twice and then triangulating the whole face can result in a zero area triangle face between points 1,2,3.
Is this behavior acceptable or should the triangulation routine recognize that these vertices are all in a line and change its subdivision strategy?
#hw6
This behavior is acceptable, as Catmull-Clark subdivision will never result in such a scenario.

###question @202
Should triangulate faces split a face that is already a triangle?
#hw6
no

###question @204
Polar Spherical Camera Reference Point
When the camera's reference point changes from panning it, should the camera now move along a sphere centered at this new reference point or the origin still?
#hw6
The camera should move along a sphere centered at the new reference point.

###question @205
normals flip when edges are split on a face
any idea what's going on maybe? i dont modify the normals in any way and the linking of syms and vertices and nextedges all look correct when i test in mainwindow.
#hw6
The edges could be in the wrong direction which can change the direction of the normals when you calculate the cross-product to populate the normal's VBO data.

###question @209
Speed of cow smoothing?
Hi, just wanted to know how fast the smoothing should be on the moo beast. Mine works fine for the dodecahedron and the cube; but it's taking a couple minutes now on the cow :( 
#hw6
It should take around 10 seconds. It also depends on your machinery

###question @210
HW6 Camera
Why do we have to change the position of eye when the camera is panned? Shouldn't the eye always be calculated as rotate(theta, y_axis) * rotate(phi, x_axis) * translate(zoom, z_axis)*unit ?
Also, wouldn't always calculating the eye as rotate(theta, y_axis) * rotate(phi, x_axis) * translate(zoom, z_axis)*unit fix the eye at the same sphere in world space, regardless of its ref point? According to Camera.h, eye is the position of the camera in world space .
Thank you so much for helping.
#hw6
We can keep track of how much we panned our camera, and translate our eye by that after doing rotate*rotate*translate. We can translate the ref point by that as well.

###question @211
HW6 Camera Implementation
Are we free to use the code from HW4 to implement the polar camera? Adam showed this in class so I was wondering if we were allowed to do so
#hw6
I think as long as the result is correct It's fine. But you should also know how to implement it by yourself.

###question @213
Polar Spherical Camera controls
What should the controls for rotation, panning, and zooming be? Should we follow the same controls from hw4? (left click for rotation, right click for pan, and scroll for zoom) Or should we change the current implementations of the arrow keys for rotation, W and S for zooming, A and D for panning?
#hw6
Resolved in OH: We can just overwrite the current functionalities of arrow keys, and WASD. We can implement hw4 controls if we want to.
